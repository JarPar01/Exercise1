#Create a new R script. Use the iris dataset 
#(this comes with base R so if you type iris in the console you will see the data)
#and plot the Sepal.Length vs Sepal.Width.

#Save the script. Make sure itâ€™s in the same folder as the other files for this project.
#The saved file should appear in the Git tab with yellow squares next to it. 
#Add and commit the file, then push it to the remote repository. Check that it has appeared in GitHub.
